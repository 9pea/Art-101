         <p>
		My biggest challenge for this assignment was definitely trying to get the child function to work in-sync with the 
    parent function. There were a lot of trial and error especially with trying to even call the parent function in 
    the first place because I was still trying to understand what all of the variables/placeholders in the parentheses 
    of the functions meant and what I had to do to have them show up on the canvas. However, I think that this is the most
    fun that I have had so far working on the assignments because getting to experiment with the code and seeing what 
    hideous creature came of it was hilarious. For this assignment I mainly focused on just forming my creature 
    first with written arguments in the parent functions and then I tried to translate some of those codes into child 
    functions. <br>
     I attempted to apply the use of basic vector behavior (bounce), offset ans scaling of parameter values to 
    effect drawing function behaviors, transform/rotate/scale, 2 custom functions without arguments, 2 different custom
    functions with arguments, calling child functions at least twice, 2 or more parent function containing child function,
    2 copies of 1 creature with transform tools to change them, push/pop, and creating custom function names.  <br>

		<p>
		For Exercise 4, my biggest challenge was trying to turn my creature into a class and making it work with the codes 
  that we had to move it around. It was difficult trying to figure out what parts of my creature could be moved without 
   affecting its overall look. The highlight was definitely getting the eyes to blink on the two creatures. The easiest 
   was implementing Jupiter's creature because their code was easy to understand and it did not need a lot of tweaking
   in the first place besides me having to edit the eyes of the cat to make it blink like my own creature. <br>
   I tried to 
  apply the concepts of turning the creature function into a class and using 'push/pop transform tools' to control the 
   graphics on the screen; have all functions insde the custom class and turned into display/action methods; having at
    least 2 different action methods you can witness with keyboard & mouse; make multiple objects by putting them into 
   array; creating 15 objects based on my own class; using vector movement codes learned in Ex3; and implementing a 
    classmate's creature code. The programming language elements I demonstrated for this assignment were the use of [] 
    and {} to utilized array structures; the used of length property to find the number of items in my object array; 
  and the use of class, constructor, and new commands. </code><br>

         <h5> Project 2</h5>
		<p>
    For Project 2, I utilized the "Penrose Tiles" algorithm as the background set piece in order to add the "Noise Wave"
    algorithm and my own creature from Ex3 in a sequence. My biggest challenge in this assignment was trying to 
    those two codes and making them work. Another major obstacle was recording the video. Since my laptop is not that 
    strong, it took a long time to get even just a 15 second video which made it hard to test out if the recording went 
    well. Overall, I am just happy that I finally got everything implemented correctly and that the recording actually 
    worked well enough where the viewer could see the detail in the movements. <br>
    For this assignment I tried to incorporate the integration of one or more algoritms; a custom class with 3 or more 
    arguments; creating an animation that changes, use of FrameCount and SaveFrame to make complex animations; no realtime
    user input; extending/transforming the algorithm examples, and making a HD hi rez video about 33 seconds long. <br>
