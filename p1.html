		This was my first time ever working with the p5.js program and my first time doing any coding since high school.
    It was difficult trying to understand what was required for this assignment with so much code being thrown at us
    in a short amount of time. However, I think that it was helpful because we got all of these new concepts to 
    practice with which did make me feel more confident when the time came to do Project 1.
    I attempted to use nested 'for loop' statements, nested 'if' statements, overloaded functions, concatenation and the use of console.log,
    combining different codes, and initializing and assigning variable. <br>

		In this assignment, it was quite overwhelming because I was still just getting used to how everything worked.
    The concepts covered in this exercise were even harder to understand but I feel like that allowed for more
    experimentation. I mainly just focused on making the external image and font assets load successfully. In 
    this piece, I attempted to apply the use of global and local varaible, use of global variables to influence states of count and reset, 
     use of && to create and/or logic that influences 'if' statements, use of external assets, use of switch statements, and use of a grid-based 
     positioning system.<br>

		<p>
    I did not have a plan going into this project. My goal was to
    just experiment with the code and create brushes that were distinct and unique from 
    each other. The sketching program consists of four unique brushes, an eraser brush, a 
    canvas reset button, and a screenshot button.   <br>    
        What I found successful was finding an aesthetic that would work for the brushes 
        which I believe is a more abstract style that involves a lot of movement. I am proud
        of myself for getting the increase/decrease value switch to work which I feel adds 
        more functionality to this drawing program. <br>
        What I found challenging was getting the brush codes to work in the first place. 
        I would say that my coding knowledge is still limited so trying to get those codes
        to work in unison while also trying to make brushes that looked uniqued was a good
        challenge. Additionally, I also had a hard time with figuring out how to stop
        the elements of one brush affecting the other, such as the stroke for one affecting the 
        stroke for the one that gets used after, but I am glad that I was able to fix that 
        issue. <br>
