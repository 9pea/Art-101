         <p>
		   For Exercise 6, we were told to mess around with the two examples provided and exchange out the assets to see what they do. I chose to 
       use Example2 which includes the p5.play library and the "ghosty" sprite. I just changed the sprite into a series of emojis. I changed 
       the long sound file and the short sound file. I messed around with the shapes and backgrounds. I made a fourth page as well with buttons 
       that would allow the viewer to click trhough all of them on screen. <br>

         <h5>Project 4</h5>
		<p>
		  For Project 4, I wanted to reuse my idea from Project 3 with focusing the theme on emojis as a way to convey emotions. The inspiration for how I wanted to approach this came from the Jennifer Daniel reading about how the meanings 
      of emojis can cahnge based on the context and how they are designed. That was my favorite reading throughout the entire semester so I wanted to apply some of what I learned from it. I utilised the second example from Exercise 6
      along with the included 'p5.play.js' code as a base. For this project, the libraries I used were 'p5.play', 'scenemanager', and 'p5.sound'. I think that
      this was the hardest project in this semester because we did not have a lot of time to do it, most aspects of the code were completely new (to me at least), and 
      we did not have a lot of time in class for demos. That's why for this project I just wanted to keep it simple and make a semi-wikipage for people to click 
      around and discover what emojis have the same meaning and how they could change based on the context.<br>

      The viewer starts off on the splash screen where they can either click on the Explore Now button to continue forward or the Info button to get help. On the main page, they are 
      presented with four different emojis (angry, rolling crying, sad, and heart) and 4 buttons that take them to four different pages. The emojis on the main page are supposed to be emojis that have very concrete and obvious meanings 
      that normally do not change even in different contexts. There is also an animated sprite in the middle that the viewer can hover over to see it going through 
      the different emojis just for fun while they listen to the background music. The next four pages that the viewer can click on contains emojis that have the same meaning as the main one 
      but they can change depending on the context. On those pages, they can click on the Back button to go back to the splash page. Finally, the help page just contains instructions 
      for how to navigate everything. Furthermore, the all the buttons, except for the 'Info!' button, has a sound effect to indicate that they have been clicked on. The four buttons that the viewer can click on to view the other emojis 
      have sound effects that matches the emotion they represent when you click on them.<br>

      All in all, I am satisfied with how this project turned out with such a tight work time.<br>
      For the button sound effects, I got the sound from <a href="https://www.zapsplat.com/basic-member-home/" >ZapSplat</a> <br>
      For the background music, I got it from <a href="https://youtu.be/DSWYAclv2I8?si=uZ_iuWZ7udpBeB10" >Chillpeach - In Dreamland</a> <br>
